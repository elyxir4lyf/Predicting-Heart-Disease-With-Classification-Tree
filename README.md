# Predicting Heart Disease With Classification Tree
---


## <u>Introdution</u>

Classification Tree is an algorithm where the target variable is fixed or categorical. The algorithm is then used to identify the class within which a target variable would most likely fall. They are used when the dataset needs to be split into classes that belong to the response variable. In many cases, the classes Yes or No. In other words, they are just two and mutually exclusive. In some cases, there may be more than two classes in which case a variant of the classification tree algorithm is used. Classification Trees are an exceptionally useful machine learning method emplyed when one needs to know how decisions are been made. For example, if one has to justify the prediction to one's superior, they are a good method beause each step in the decision making process is easitly understandable.


## <u>Methodology</u>

In this analysis, I leverage skicit-learn and Cost Complexity Pruning to build a classification tree, which uses continuous and categorical data fom UCI Machine Learnig to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease.

## <u>About The Dataset</u>

Detail about the Heart Disease dataset can be gotten from the [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) platform.
